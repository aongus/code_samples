# code_samples

A collection of sample codes covering machine learning and robotics.

**classification_logistic.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook using baby-related item reviews from Amazon to build a bag-of-words model for sentiment analysis with logistic regression. Uses the **amazon_baby.csv** data. 

Due to Github space requirements, the data file has been split. Use cat amazon_baby.csv.zip.* > amazon_baby.csv.zip

**EKF.py** : An extended (nonlinear) Kalman filter for noisy test data (accelerometer & gyroscope). Uses the Matlab data file **data.mat**
