# code_samples

A collection of sample codes covering machine learning and robotics.

**classification_logistic.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook using baby-related item reviews from Amazon to build a bag-of-words model for sentiment analysis with logistic regression. Uses the **amazon_baby.csv** dataset. 

Due to Github space requirements, the data file has been split. Use `cat amazon_baby.csv.* > amazon_baby.csv` to recombine.

**Decision_trees.ipynb**: A Jupyer notebook using lending data to build single and boosted decision trees. Uses the **lending-club-data.csv** dataset.

Due to Github space requirements, the data file has been split. Use `cat lending-club-data.csv.* > lending-club-data.csv` to recombine.

**EKF.py** : An extended (nonlinear) Kalman filter for noisy test data (accelerometer & gyroscope). Uses the Matlab data file **data.mat**
